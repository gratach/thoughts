[previous](2024-04.md)
### 1)
Added [subtopic-tree-comparison](../../topics/master-thesis/evaluation/subtopic-tree-comparison.md) for different creation algorithms

### 3)
Described [new metric](../../topics/master-thesis/evaluation/false-choices-per-correct-choice-compared-to-random.md) for measuring the quality of generated predicates.

### 6)
[Evaluated](../../topics/master-thesis/evaluation/physics-term-correlation-network-evaluation.md) the created correlation graphs of the physics terms

### 7)
Generated a list of semantic triples using the [diverse-connections-between-existing-topics](../../topics/master-thesis/approaches/diverse-connections-between-existing-topics.md) approach

### 8)
Collected thoughts on how to continue the master thesis after the evaluation of the semantic triples. One idea is to [build an navigation mechanism](navigate-infinitely-large-semantic-network-by-choices.md)  for changing position within a semantic network by finite decisions.

### 11)
Testet different [prompts-for-tree-sorted-semantic-network](../../topics/master-thesis/approaches/prompts-for-tree-sorted-semantic-network.md)

### 13)
Written the [correlated-triples-evaluation](../../topics/master-thesis/evaluation/correlated-triples-evaluation.md)

### 15)
Collected [ideas-on-how-to-continue-the-master-thesis](../../topics/master-thesis/approaches/ideas-on-how-to-continue-the-master-thesis.md)

### 29)
Documented the results of the [manual-triple-evaluation](../../topics/master-thesis/evaluation/manual-triple-evaluation.md)

### 31)
Added idea for a [network-of-equations](network-of-equations.md)

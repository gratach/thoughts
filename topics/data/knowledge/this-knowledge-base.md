This knowledge base is an attempt to collect various ideas on different subject areas and make them accessible to the public. 

It is designed as a file tree made up of Markdown files that is contained in a git repository. This repository is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/gratach/thoughts/) and can be also viewed and browsed on that page. Another way to make the database navigable is to convert it into a static website using Sphinx.

```
sphinx-build <input-filename> <output-filename>
```

The knowledge base is also designed to be used with Obsidian, which can be particularly helpful for editing linked files. However, the inserted images cannot be viewed with obsidian. Github and Sphinx also do not support the link scheme typical of Obsidian:
```[[meinlink]]``` 
So markdown style links have to be used 
```[Link name](./relative/adress)```

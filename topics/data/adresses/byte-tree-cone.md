# Byte tree cone

A byte tree cone is a reference to an edge of the [byte tree graph](byte-tree-graph.md) together with a direction pointing to one of the two nodes that are connected by this edge. A byte tree cone can be used as starting point for referencing a node of the byte tree graph by using a [byte-tree-address](byte-tree-address.md). It also splits the whole graph into two parts. One part that is within the byte tree cone and one part that lies outside the byte tree cone. An node lies in the byte tree cone if it can be reached by navigating trough the graph without turning back and starting from the edge of the byte tree cone in the direction of the byte tree cone.

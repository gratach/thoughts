# Byte tree cone

A byte tree cone is a reference to an edge of the [byte tree graph](byte-tree-graph.md) together with a direction pointing to one of the two nodes that are connected by this edge. A byte tree cone can be used as starting point for referencing a node of the byte tree graph by using a [byte-tree-address](byte-tree-address.md)

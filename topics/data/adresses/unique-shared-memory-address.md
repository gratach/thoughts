# Unique Shared Memory Address (USMA)

An unique shared memory address is an address of a address system that should be not only locally valid but across all applications on the world. The memory address system should be thereby not centralized but distributed an decentralized using encryption technology.

The format of an USMA address is that of an [byte-tree-address](byte-tree-address.md) that is encoded in the [standard-byte-tree-address-format](standard-byte-tree-address-format.md)



Use cases of a USMA could be a [decentralized package manager](../../code/ideas/decentralized-package-manager.md) and a decentralized knowledge graph.

An attempt to implement an decentralized USMA managing system is the [distrida](../../code/projects/distrida.md) project.
An alternative attempt to create an international decentralized address space is the [dunin project](../../graph/organizing/dwll-url-node-identification-namespace.md)

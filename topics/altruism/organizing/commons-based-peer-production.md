# Commons based peer production

[Common based peer production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production) is the process when people work together on non-profit projects with flat hierarchical structures. The work is voluntary and often conducted with the support of internet communication tools.

A [public-project-collection](public-project-collection.md) could support people in finding like-minded people.
The work could be coordinated with [public-todo-lists](public-todo-list.md).


Commons based peer production projects could be open source software or [open-source-hardware](../../world/hardware/open-source-hardware.md) related.

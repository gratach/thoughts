# Public project organization existing software research

## Question:

I am looking for a way to organize the planning of public projects such as the development of a online discussion forum as described [here](https://debablo.de/planung/forum_konzeptentwurf.pdf) or the foundation of a democratic organization that supports projects for the common good.

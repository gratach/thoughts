# Public project organization existing software research

## Question:

I am looking for a way to organize the planning of public projects such as the development of a online discussion forum as described [here](https://debablo.de/planung/forum_konzeptentwurf.pdf) or the foundation of a democratic organization that supports projects for the common good as described [here](https://github.com/gratach/thoughts/blob/master/topics/altruism/democracy/democratic-software-development-project.md).

What existing Software could be used for puplic project planning? As many of the following features as possible should be supported:

* It should be possible to define TODOs, milestones and long term goals
* The progress should be tracked. Tasks which are fulfilled should be marked as such
* It should be possible to organize TODOs by priority
* The project planing software should be accessible via a web browser 
* The whole content of the project planning should be publicly available
* The content should be accessible for reading without registration 
* The software used for project planning should be open source
* It should be possible to download the project planning data and migrate it to an other server
* Multiple people should be able to cooperate on the same project and distribute tasks among them
* The application should be scalable and allow big numbers of people to join the project planning
* Everybody who wants to participate should be able to do so 
* Even though everybody should be able to contribute there should be mechanisms that prevent sabotage
* The progress should be tracked
* Automatic backups
* A seamless workflow should be possible between working with the project planning software and cooperating on creating content like software and documentation
* It should be possible to integrate AI tools in the workflow and automate processes
* It would be nice if mechanisms to find consensus are integrated within the platform 
* The project planning software should be easy to use and understand

What tools can you find that are suitable to fulfill those requirements?

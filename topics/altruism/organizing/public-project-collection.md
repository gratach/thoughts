# Public project collection

When people want to [collectively work on projects for the common good](commons-based-peer-production.md) they need a method to find like minded supporters of the same goals. To help organizing this a forum could help where people can register new projects on which they want to work. On such a platform the contact information of all people who want to get involved in a project could be collected so that they can get in contact with each other.
Such a platform could also include a [public-todo-list](public-todo-list.md) that can help people identify tasks that have to be done next.

An outdated example of a public project collection is the [Ourproject](https://ourproject.org/) web page. This web page makes it possible to commit new projects.

A more static collection of open projects is [Libreproject](https://libreprojects.net)

# Latex

Compile a latex file with the .tex ending into a pdf using
```
pdflatex file_to_compile.tex
```
This produces a `file_to_compile.pdf` together with an `.aux` file and a `.log` file.

The LaTeX file can also be built into a live pdf version using the LaTeX workshop extension of visual studio code.

An example of a latex file is [my masters thesis](https://github.com/gratach/master-thesis-latex/blob/main/masterthesis.tex)

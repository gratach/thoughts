# Automated transactions

What technology can be used to make money transfers in the internet in a way that the following criteria are fulfilled:

* The transfers are not dependent on a centralized entity
* The transfers can be automated by programs via an interface that is easy to use
* The transaction costs are low
* The transaction speed is fast
* The transaction method is legal

Such a transaction method is required by [decentralized services on the internet](../ideas/services-on-the-internet.md) that are executed in real time when the transfer is initialized.

Would it be possible to combine multiple payment technologies in one uniform interface?

Here is a list of existing technologies that are implementing similar functionality

# Online identification mechanisms

Some applications like [online voting](../../altruism/democracy/how-to-organize-a-democratic-online-vote.md) and [the use of safety-critical services on the internet](../ideas/services-on-the-internet.md) might require that some proof of identity of the legal entity that is responsible for the action is provided.

At this place different methods of online identification mechanisms should be collected:

* [World coin](https://worldcoin.org) is a for profit cryptocurrency project that uses a "world id" for identifying individuals. 
* [Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a protocol for computer network identification that relies on a trusted third party.
* The online ID function of the federal republic of Germany [can be used](https://www.die-online-ausweisfunktion.de/leitfaden-zur-implementierung/implementierung-der-online-ausweisfunktion/) by implementing a [eID-Server](https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Themen/Oeffentliche-Verwaltung/Elektronische-Identitaeten/Online-Ausweisfunktion/Testinfrastruktur/eID-Server/eID-Server.html). The development and operation of such a service is complicated and requires high security standards and an authorization certificate.

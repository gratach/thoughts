# Services on the internet

Here I want to describe my idealized vision of a world were services on the Internet are available via an easy usable interface:

In this vision every service on the internet is available via an uniform interface that can be used manually and by programming code. This interface should not be dependent on any third party platform. Everybody should be able to offer a service via this interface. Each service should be identified by an URL and the interface that can be used to access the service should be reachable by calling this URL.

Here are some ideas of services that could be offered in such a way:

* A service that allows one to store data for a given time period.
* A service that allows one to run some code in a predefined environment and returns the result.
* A service that researches some information and returns them in a structured fashion.
* A service that offers content
* A service that translates some text in an other language.
* A service that orders some goods and sends them to a given address.
* A service that constructs some custom objects by using a given blueprint and sends them to a given address.
* A service that takes some natural language command and executes them.

Companies could offer their products or services by using such a interface. Non profit organizations could make their work available via this API. Governments could give the public access to their administrative tasks via this API.

In order to execute the task of a user that uses such a service the protocol might demand some requirements that have to be fulfilled. For example a service might demand a payment. This could be realized by some kind of [automated just in time transaction method](../technologies/automated-transactions.md). Other services might demand the indication and verification of an responsible person that can be hold accountable for the consequences of the executed task. To implement this an [online identification mechanism](../technologies/online-identification-mechanisms.md) is needed.

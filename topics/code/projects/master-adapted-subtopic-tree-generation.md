A project for the generation of a subtopic tree that is adapted to a list of specified terms.

[sort-a-list-of-terms-into-a-subtopic-tree](../../data/knowledge/sort-a-list-of-terms-into-a-subtopic-tree.md)

This project also contains:
* [Evaluation](../../master-thesis/evaluation/physics-term-adapted-subtopic-tree-evaluation.md) algorithms for the subtopic tree
* A correlation network generation implementation
* [Evaluation](../../master-thesis/evaluation/physics-term-correlation-network-evaluation.md) algorithms for the correlation network
* A triple generation implementation

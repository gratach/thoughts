# Reserved dunin id

A reserved dunin ID is a [[dunin-id]] that does not yet reference a [[dunin-node]]. It is owned by the [[dunin-agent]] that is referenced by the [[dunin-agent-locator]] of the dunin ID. A reserved dunin ID can already be referenced in the link list of other dunin nodes even if the content is not yet defined.

According to the [[rules-for-using-dunin-ids]] a dunin id stays reserved as long as the owning dunin agent does not tell any external entity what the content of the dunin ID is.

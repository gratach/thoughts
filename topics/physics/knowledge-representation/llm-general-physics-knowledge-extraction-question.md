# Is it possible to extract the internal physics knowledge of a large language model as semantic network?

The answer of this question depends on the answer of the following questions:
* [How can general knowledge be represented as a semantic network?](../../data/knowledge/knowledge-representation-as-semantic-network-question.md)
* What questions to ask a LLM to generate a semantic network? 
* How can one evaluate the result?
* What are the peculiarities of physics knowledge?

The following approaches can be used for extracting the physics knowledge from a LLM:
* Building a subtopic network

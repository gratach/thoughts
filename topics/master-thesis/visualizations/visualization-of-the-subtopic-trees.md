# Visualization of the subtopic trees

The subtopic trees can be visualized as graph using the ```vis.js``` library. Thereby the leaf nodes of the subtopic tree are colored in blue while the junction nodes are colored in blue. The graphic below shows an overview over the ```subd``` tree. The root node, which is colored in pink can be seen in the right center.

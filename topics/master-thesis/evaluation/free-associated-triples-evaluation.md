The [false-choices-per-correct-choice-compared-to-random](../equations/false-choices-per-correct-choice-compared-to-random.md) metric that  [was previously applied](correlated-triples-evaluation.md) to the correlated triples was now also applied to the free associated triples.
Therefore `gpt-3.5-turbo`was asked to generate triples that have a subject from the list of the [dataset-of-1038-physic-terms](dataset-of-1038-physic-terms.md). For each term from this list `gpt-3.5-turbo`was prompted to generate a list of 5 triples that have this term as subject. From this 5 triples one was selected and the model was asked to identify its object from the selection of the objects of all 5 triples.

This evaluation was calculated for a total of 200 physics terms. The calculated number for the ==false object guesses per correct guess in relation to random guessing== is ==0.367±0.053==. This is approximately half as high as the same quantity that was calculated for the correlated triples (0.630±0.063). Therefore one can estimate that the meaningfulness of the freely associated triples is higher than the meaningfulness of the correlated triples.

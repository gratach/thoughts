# Subtopic tree comparison

This plot shows the [viewed bytes percentage](subtopic-tree-average-number-of-viewed-terms-per-search-evaluation.md) in dependency of the average subbranches per junction for subtopic trees that are created from different creation methods and prompts.

Creation methods:

| Name         | Description                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| subd         | Subdivision algorithm                                                  |
| fr_as_ex     | Free association algorithm with subtopic extensions                    |
| fr_as_rsb_15 | Free association algorithm with subbranches count 15 only at root node |
| fr_as_rsb_16 | Free association algorithm with subbranches count 16 only at root node |
| fr_as_sb_10  | Free association algorithm with subbranches count 10                   |
| fr_as_sb_15  | Free association algorithm with subbranches count 15                   |
Note that the error bars only show the ==viewed bytes percentage error== for the evaluation of ==a single subtopic tree== that was generated by the creation algorithm not the error that originates from multiple different subtopic tree creations.

Here is a table statistical properties of the subtopic trees created with different creation methods:

| Tree         | Average term depth | Average number of subbranches per supporting junction node | Average viewed nodes fraction | Average viewed bytes fraction | Average choice correctness percentage |

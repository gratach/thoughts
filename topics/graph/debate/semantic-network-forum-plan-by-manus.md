## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for developing a forum system structured as a semantic network of questions and answers, as described in the [forum-concept-draft](forum-concept-draft.md). The proposed system will visualize discussions as interactive mindmaps, allowing users to navigate complex discussions through a network of semantically linked contributions. The plan includes analysis of requirements, technical specifications, implementation phases, timeline estimates, resource requirements, and risk management strategies.

## Introduction

Traditional forum systems organize discussions in a linear or hierarchical structure, which can make it difficult to follow complex discussions with multiple related topics. The Mindmap-Forum concept proposes a novel approach to online discussions by structuring them as semantic networks, visualized as interactive mindmaps. This approach aims to address two key limitations of traditional forums:

1. Lack of support for network-like discussion topographies
2. Lack of consolidation of identical comments

The proposed system will allow users to create, navigate, and contribute to discussions in a more intuitive and visually engaging way, with support for context-dependent contributions and multi-focus navigation.

## Concept Analysis

### Semantic Networks and Mindmaps

Semantic networks are graph structures that represent knowledge as a network of concepts (nodes) connected by relationships (edges). Unlike traditional mind maps, which are hierarchical tree structures with a central topic, semantic networks allow for more complex relationships between concepts, with any node potentially connecting to any other node.

The Mindmap-Forum concept combines elements of both:
- It uses mindmap-like visualization for intuitive navigation
- It incorporates semantic network principles for representing complex relationships between contributions
- It adds innovative features like context-dependent contributions and multi-focus navigation

### Key Features from the Concept Document

1. **Mindmap Visualization**: Discussions are visualized as mindmaps with nodes representing contributions and edges representing relationships.

2. **Content Structuring**: The system supports different types of contributions (questions, answers, comments) with various relationship types (e.g., question-answer, agreement-disagreement).

3. **New Contribution Creation**: Users can create new contributions with specified relationships to existing content.

4. **Options Menu**: An interface for specifying relationship types and other contribution properties.

5. **Content Consolidation**: There should be a mechanism to consolidate identical contributions from different parts of the network.

6. **Criteria for Consolidation**: Rules for determining when contributions should be consolidated.

7. **Context-Dependent Contributions**: Support for contributions that relate to specific contexts within the discussion.

8. **Multi-Focus Navigation**: Ability to focus on multiple parts of the discussion simultaneously.

9. **Implementation**: Web application using Python (server-side) and JavaScript (client-side).

When new connections are added to a semantic network the question arises how to incorporate this new information in the already existing data without changing the identity of the already existing concepts.

One way to handle this is to add an additional layer of joined concepts to the already existing atomic concepts. The idea behind this is, that the atomic concepts holds only the information of one or few connections connected to it but the joined concepts summ up one or many of these atomic concepts to an entity. Thereby the joined concepts are not saved in the database but instead constructed on the fly from the layer of atomic concepts.

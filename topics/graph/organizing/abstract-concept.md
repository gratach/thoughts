# Abstract Concept

An abstract concept is a concept of a [conceptlogic](../conceptlogic/conceptlogic.md) that represents a other concept of the conceptlogic or of an unspecified extension of the conceptlogic. The concept that is represented by the abstract concept is not necessarily well-defined, while the abstract concept itself is well-defined. There are multiple types of abstract concepts:
    - Constructed Abstractions
    - Referenced Abstractions
    - [joined-concepts](joined-concepts.md)

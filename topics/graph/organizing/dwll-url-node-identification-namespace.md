# Dwll url node identification namespace

The **dunin** (Dwll url node identification namespace) is a [node-identification-namespace](node-identification-namespace.md) for the [dwll network](../../data/graph/data-with-link-list-network.md). It is an attempt to identify data resources ([dunin nodes](dunin-node.md)) with unique byte addresses that are not only valid within one computer but globally on the world wide web.
Such an byte address is called a [dunin ID](../../data/adresses/dunin-id.md). There are [rules for using dunin ids](../../data/adresses/rules-for-using-dunin-ids.md) and assigning dunin nodes to them. Data that is stored within the dunin can be easily made [public available](../../code/technologies/how-to-make-data-public.md) via the [dunin-http-interface](../../code/interfaces/dunin-http-interface.md).


The [http-dunin-agent project](../../code/projects/http-dunin-agent) is an attempt to implement a dunin agent.

An alternative attempt to create and global decentralized address system is the [usma system](../../data/adresses/unique-shared-memory-address.md).

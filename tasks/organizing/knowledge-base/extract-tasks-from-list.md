# Extract tasks from list

Extract the list of tasks from [todo-1-100](../../../planning/todos/todo-1-100.md) and create one markdown file for each of these tasks which get placed in the tasks folder at the root of this repository. The file name should be short descriptions of the tasks (not much more than 30 charackters. Different words separated by dashes). The markdown file should contain a long description of the task and the todo hashtag of the task such as `#todo1`. Finally it should contain the status of the task (in this case pending). Each task file should look like this file (the task description might be shorter if it is not clear what is meant by the task mentioned in the list).
